Manickam and his friend Prakash decide to buy the land in order to start searching for the treasure before others do. They are small-time crooks who want the treasure at any cost. They plow the land and uncover a large object carved with hideous figures.

Madasamy is a skilled locksmith who lives with his sister Rajeshwari. He discovers that the village's doctor, Vasanth, is secretly in love with his sister, and he decides to arrange their marriage. The doctor's family asks for a huge dowry for his sister, which Madasamy accepts. He then decides to find work in the city hoping to earn a greater salary. As Madasamy is leaving the village, he meets Prakash and Manickam who ask him for a favor. They offer him money to accompany them to the palace.

The three visit the palace that same night, and Madasamy manages to open its main safe. Prakash and Manickam give him enough money to fund his sister's wedding and Madasamy leaves. In the safe, a manuscript explains how to obtain the treasure. A few days later, on the night of the full moon, Prakash and Manickam return to the palace. There, Prakash beats up Manickam with the intention of keeping the treasure for himself. Alone, Prakash conducts the ritual as described in the manuscript. However, to his astonishment, he summons a satanic spirit that ends up killing him. The spirit flees the palace and encounters Rajeshwari, ""possessing"" his body.

Meanwhile, Madasamy arranges his sister's wedding and goes to Chennai to consult an astrologer. The astrologer says his sister's marriage will happen successfully, but Ra Sankaran says it will not. Madasamy gets angry and tries to beat him. In the ensuing scuffle, Madasamy is arrested by the police.

Rajeshwari faints during the wedding ceremony and the groom's family halt the proceedings. The groom, Vasanth, questions the paternity of the child Rajeshwari is revealed to be carrying. Still possessed by the evil spirit, she kills Vasanth. Madasamy returns home to discover his sister has murdered her lover. He takes his sister to a doctor, but the doctor is a fraud who has been conjured by the devil and declares Rajeshwari not pregnant. Ra Sankaran then discovers that the doctor is an aspect of the evil spirit, eventually killing him. The murder of Ra Sankaran is observed by Madasamy in a reflection on the water that reveals the doctor in his true ghostly form.

Ra Sankaran advises him to go to Ammapettai Kali temple to discover the truth. He complies and finds that in his previous life he was a general in Jameen Kottai. The Jameen wanted to be immortal and so on the advice of Mahakanni, an old sorceress, he planned to kill 99 people who were born in Rohini star and Kanni Lagna. Since Madasamy had the same Nakshatra, he was killed. Madasamy planned to marry Mohini. Mahakanni advises Jameen to have sex with Rajeshwari who is a sister to Madasamy and sacrifice the child to Satan. Jameen and his men try to rape Mohini and Rajeshwari, but Mohini, using her power of chastity, burns Jameen and his army. Due to his sacrifices, Jameen's heart is not destroyed and Mahakanni promises Jameen that on the 7th generation, they will be reborn and fulfill his destiny. Madasamy tries to possess Jameen Kottai and destroy the heart, but the spirits make him old and sap him of his youth. The Supreme Goddess Bhadrakali, who is a famous deity in the preceding devotional neighborhood village Ammanoor, then kills the Satanic spirit from the Jameen Kottai and saves everyone in the village. Thus the film concludes with a happy, and devotional ending.",jameen kottai,the title of the film jameen kottai refers to a remote haunted location where the main events take place the local villagers fear jameen kottai and the guards that protect it many believe that a secret treasure is hidden in the palace one day ra sankaran and his daughter mohini arrive at the palace where she has a vision of a past life meanwhile an elderly lady secretly records the conversation of a group plotting to retrieve the treasure the lather gives the recording to manickam who finds a clue relating to the location of the treasure which then leads him to karuvapatti manickam and his friend prakash decide to buy the land in order to start searching for the treasure before others do they are small time crooks who want the treasure at any cost they plow the land and uncover a large object carved with hideous figures madasamy is a skilled locksmith who lives with his sister rajeshwari he discovers that the village s doctor vasanth is secretly in love with his sister and he decides to arrange their marriage the doctor s family asks for a huge dowry for his sister which madasamy accepts he then decides to find work in the city hoping to earn a greater salary as madasamy is leaving the village he meets prakash and manickam who ask him for a favor they offer him money to accompany them to the palace the three visit the palace that same night and madasamy manages to open its main safe prakash and manickam give him enough money to fund his sister s wedding and madasamy leaves in the safe a manuscript explains how to obtain the treasure a few days later on the night of the full moon prakash and manickam return to the palace there prakash beats up manickam with the intention of keeping the treasure for himself alone prakash conducts the ritual as described in the manuscript however to his astonishment he summons a satanic spirit that ends up killing him the spirit flees the palace and encounters rajeshwari possessing his body meanwhile madasamy arranges his sister s wedding and goes to chennai to consult an astrologer the astrologer says his sister s marriage will happen successfully but ra sankaran says it will not madasamy gets angry and tries to beat him in the ensuing scuffle madasamy is arrested by the police rajeshwari faints during the wedding ceremony and the groom s family halt the proceedings the groom vasanth questions the paternity of the child rajeshwari is revealed to be carrying still possessed by the evil spirit she kills vasanth madasamy returns home to discover his sister has murdered her lover he takes his sister to a doctor but the doctor is a fraud who has been conjured by the devil and declares rajeshwari not pregnant ra sankaran then discovers that the doctor is an aspect of the evil spirit eventually killing him the murder of ra sankaran is observed by madasamy in a reflection on the water that reveals the doctor in his true ghostly form ra sankaran advises him to go to ammapettai kali temple to discover the truth he complies and finds that in his previous life he was a general in jameen kottai the jameen wanted to be immortal and so on the advice of mahakanni an old sorceress he planned to kill 99 people who were born in rohini star and kanni lagna since madasamy had the same nakshatra he was killed madasamy planned to marry mohini mahakanni advises jameen to have sex with rajeshwari who is a sister to madasamy and sacrifice the child to satan jameen and his men try to rape mohini and rajeshwari but mohini using her power of chastity burns jameen and his army due to his sacrifices jameen s heart is not destroyed and mahakanni promises jameen that on the 7th generation they will be reborn and fulfill his destiny madasamy tries to possess jameen kottai and destroy the heart but the spirits make him old and sap him of his youth the supreme goddess bhadrakali who is a famous deity in the preceding devotional neighborhood village ammanoor then kills the satanic spirit from the jameen kottai and saves everyone in the village thus the film concludes with a happy and devotional ending

Father James finds inside the coffin, a dead body of Babu (Raja) stabbed in the heart with a knife, so he immediately calls the police. The police inspector Rangaraj after seeing the dead body decided to hush up the issue and buried the coffin. The news was spread rapidly and it is now on the front pages of every newspaper. Very quickly, the police were being heavily criticised for smothering up the sordid affair. SP Vikramadithyan (Prem Menon) decides to take up himself in this sordid case. He digs up the coffin and sends the corpse to the post-mortem examination. Vikramadithyan first examines the Father church James and James tells what happened in the past. Babu (Raja) was a spoiled student specialist in ragging other students and in annoying the professors. Babu clashed many times with his classmate Mary (Mohini) who was a soft-spoken student and a religious person. Being an orphan, she was brought up by Father James. Babu slowly fell in love with her, he became a good man and he eventually converted to Christianity. Finally, Vincent Babu and Mary got married at the church with the blessings of Father James. At the wedding night, Babu shews his true colours. He was, in fact, a drunkard and a womanizer, he acted as a good man all along only for spending time with Mary one night and he left her the next day. Many years later, Babu reappeared as a melancholic man who lost all his wealth and asked Father James for forgiveness. Mary had a boy called Alex (Master Nadim Khan). Alex forced his mother Mary to live with Babu who had not changed at all. Babu's behaviors became worse : he behaved badly with the school teacher Poornitha (Raksha) in public, he spent time with a prostitute (Shakeela), he even tried to seduce Lakshmi (Kavitha) who resurfaced to see her daughter Mary, he drank a lot of alcohols in a bar owned by (Alex) and worst that he molested his wife and beat up his son. One night, Father James was informed of Babu's death and they all proceed to his funeral the same evening.

Seenu is very much fond of Kesavan and could not tolerate anyone speaking ill about him. Unfortunately, Kesavan develops a habit of consuming alcohol, which is only known to his wife. Kesavan's wife tries hard to stop him from consuming alcohol, but all her efforts go in vain. She does not reveal this to her family members. Seenu falls in love with his relative (Malavika). When the family members come to know about Kesavan's habit of drinking, they advise him to stop it as it will bring down the fame what he has earned so far. Kesavan does not listen to them and gets angry if someone starts advising him to stop drinking. Slowly, Kesavan's habit of consuming alcohol increases, and one day he goes to a concert after drinking and stumbles on stage. Seenu is shocked to see this and rushes to the stage. Also to calm down the crowd, Seenu starts singing in place of Kesavan in the concert. To everyone's surprise, Seenu's singing ability is great, and he is appreciated by everyone.

Prakash (Prakash Raj) the only son of a billionaire industrialist and Priya (Abhirami) an Ooty-based tea estate heiress board a train to Delhi as strangers, in the Chennai central station. They get seats next to each other and introduce themselves to one another. As a coincidence, they get to know that all 3 of them have passed the UPSC exams with high ranks, and are going to Delhi for phase-4 of their Civil Service training and become friends. During the course of the training, Surya loves Priya, whereas Prakash lusts after her. While Surya's dad Manivannan and Priya's family visit the trio in Agra, Prakash reveals to Priya's mom about his desire to marry Priya. At the same time, Surya's dad asks Surya to marry Priya. During the last days of training, Priya also falls in love with Surya. During the results of Phase 4, Priya gets selected as cadre-I IAS officer, while Prakash misses the cut-off and becomes Cadre-II IPS officer, because he had spent 2 minutes of the final exam thinking about Priya. At the same time, Surya's results are held back by the UPSC board, because of an FIR in Surya's name. 3 years earlier, Surya was a village farmer. During harvest, the local tasildar refused to pay the farmer's demand and started to forcefully take their cane crop to government stores at a cheaper price. Surya protested against this, and he hits the tasildar as the tasildar hit his father. Surya is arrested and placed in police custody. The villages continue their protest at the police station, prompting the District Collector Lakshmi IAS to come to the station the next day. She studies the situation, and causes the government to pass a GO in favor of the farmer's demands. While she asks the police to release Surya after knowing that he is a post-graduate, they refuse, as an FIR has been filed on him, and Surya must be presented before a magistrate. Shocked by this development, the Collector, in her right as District Magistrate cancels the FIR and lets Surya go free. This power of an IAS officer led to Surya taking up the UPSC exams. After Surya's explanation, UPSC agrees to let him go, but holds his result pending an inquiry. Surya and Priya then visit Lakshmi IAS, who is now deputy-Home secretary in Chennai, asking her help. After that they propose to one another, and start their one-month vacation. Surya refuses to go to his village, as he had promised that he will return only as an IAS officer. So he visits Priya's family in Ooty. Priya's mom and sister happily accept Surya as prospective groom for Priya. After a month, Priya leaves for her job as Assistant Collector in Chennai. While all goes well, it is revealed that months ago, a rich newspaper owner son Arun has tries to harass Priya's sister Pavithra during her way to school and Pavi had him imprisoned for that. Arun, in an act of vengeance, blocks Pavi's public exam number in all newspapers on the result day. Due to power failure, no news of results reaches Priya on the correct time, and Priya's mother assumes that she has failed her exam due to playfulness. Hurt, Pavi commits suicide. During her funeral, news agencies come to reveal that Pavi had come as first rank in the state. Adhi and his friend also come to the funeral. Adhi's friend reveals Adhi's misdeeds to the public and Surya pushes Adhi against a tree, in a fit of rage. Adhi gets a head injury and dies. Surya is arrested on murder charges and sent to Chennai prison for remand. At the same time, Prakash joins as an IPS officer, and begins his duty in Chennai Jail. It is revealed that Prakash is to serve for 24 hours to fulfill his father's wishes and then resign to enjoy his life as a billionaire. At the same time, Surya is brought to Prakash's jail. Prakash is initially shocked at Surya's state, but decided to use it to his advantage. He cancels his resignation plans and makes multiple attempts as Surya's life through the inmates. He also asks Surya to convince Priya to marry him. Surya agrees, and Prakash takes him out on Parole to meet Priya. There, Surya reveals that he knows that Prakash informed the UPSC about his FIR incident, and Surya will not give up Priya. This makes Prakash even angrier. Days later, Prakash receives telegram that Surya's dad is dead, but he refuses to let Surya go for the funeral. Surya is aided by a constable Alex, and he escapes via a tunnel. It turns out that Alex is on the payroll of Prakash. Within minutes of Surya's escape, Alex is killed by Prakash, and he frames Surya for that murder. He conspires with Arun's father to publish headlines that Surya has been shot dead for the murder of Alex. Surya is received by an impostor at the end of the tunnel, and realises the folly. Surya comes back to the jail by daybreak, beats Prakash black and blue, and reseals himself in his cell. The arriving officers realised Prakash's crimes and arrest him. The public outcry for Surya causes the high court to acquit him of the accidental murder, and thus Surya joins the State government as an IAS officer, and makes his dad proud.

An angry Vicky then gets into a fight with Sanjeev but Sanjeev beats him and his friends up. Nandhini's mother Pankajam (Jayachitra) becomes overprotective and she suspects her daughter of being in love with their neighbour Sanjeev. Being sick of this situation, one day, an impulsive Nandhini kisses Sanjeev in front of her mother Pankajam. The two eventually fall in love with each other. When her father (Vijayakumar), an ambassador, returns home from abroad, he tries to convince Nandhini to forget her lover but Nandhini wants to marry Sanjeev at all means. Nandhini's father then comes to know that Sanjeev killed his mother in the past and tells it to his daughter. Meanwhile, at a college excursion, Vicky and his friends try to rape their collegemate Juli (Jeeva) but Sanjeev comes to her rescue and Nandhini spits on Vicky's face. Vicky and his friends are consequently expelled from college, and Vicky swears to take revenge on the lovers. Thereafter, Nandhini compels Sanjeev to reveal the reason for killing his mother. Many years ago, Sanjeev lived with his parents who were poor labourers. After the death of his father, Lakshmi (Mounika) became vulnerable and her boss tried to woo her and one night, he entered her house and tried to rape. The young Sanjeev had no other choice than to kill his mother to save her dignity and he was sent to jail for his crime. He was then adopted by a wealthy foreigner who gave him everything except affection. Sanjeev tells Nandhini that she is the first person who showed him affection and Nandhini in tears responds that he did the right thing. Nandhini's parents decided to take their daughter with them to go abroad but they change their mind when they read her private diary and they want her to be happy. In the meantime, Nandhini meets Sanjeev at the beach to talk about it and vengeful Vicky comes to the place with his friends. During the fight, Sanjeev manages to beat them up and the couple tries to run away. Vicky then shoots Sanjeev in the legs and he tries to rape Nandhini in front of Sanjeev but Vicky leaves the gun behind him. Nandhini escapes from them and hugs a wounded Sanjeev. When Sanjeev aims the gun at them, they laugh because the gun had only one bullet left. To save his lover's virginity, Sakthi pressed Nandhini tightly in his arms and shoots in her back thus the lovers died.",manasu,sanjeev sakthi is a studious college student while the carefree vicky sanjeev kumar spends his time causing trouble in college during the college exhibition sanjeev accidentally hurts nandhini oviya on her hand and he immediately apologizes for his mistake an angry vicky then gets into a fight with sanjeev but sanjeev beats him and his friends up nandhini s mother pankajam jayachitra becomes overprotective and she suspects her daughter of being in love with their neighbour sanjeev being sick of this situation one day an impulsive nandhini kisses sanjeev in front of her mother pankajam the two eventually fall in love with each other when her father vijayakumar an ambassador returns home from abroad he tries to convince nandhini to forget her lover but nandhini wants to marry sanjeev at all means nandhini s father then comes to know that sanjeev killed his mother in the past and tells it to his daughter meanwhile at a college excursion vicky and his friends try to rape their collegemate juli jeeva but sanjeev comes to her rescue and nandhini spits on vicky s face vicky and his friends are consequently expelled from college and vicky swears to take revenge on the lovers thereafter nandhini compels sanjeev to reveal the reason for killing his mother many years ago sanjeev lived with his parents who were poor labourers after the death of his father lakshmi mounika became vulnerable and her boss tried to woo her and one night he entered her house and tried to rape the young sanjeev had no other choice than to kill his mother to save her dignity and he was sent to jail for his crime he was then adopted by a wealthy foreigner who gave him everything except affection sanjeev tells nandhini that she is the first person who showed him affection and nandhini in tears responds that he did the right thing nandhini s parents decided to take their daughter with them to go abroad but they change their mind when they read her private diary and they want her to be happy in the meantime nandhini meets sanjeev at the beach to talk about it and vengeful vicky comes to the place with his friends during the fight sanjeev manages to beat them up and the couple tries to run away vicky then shoots sanjeev in the legs and he tries to rape nandhini in front of sanjeev but vicky leaves the gun behind him nandhini escapes from them and hugs a wounded sanjeev when sanjeev aims the gun at them they laugh because the gun had only one bullet left to save his lover s virginity sakthi pressed nandhini tightly in his arms and shoots in her back thus the lovers died

Its hard hitting message screams at you from the screen, loud and clear. Hitherto, there seemed to be only a couple of angles to Child labour in India, viz., children losing out on their carefree childhood and basic formal education. But there are so many other unthought of issues too, says scriptwriter and director Poomani, through the film Karuvelam Pookkal, jointly produced by NFDC and Doordarshan. Karisalkulam, a small village, is inhabited mainly by Farmers. When the arid land offers them nothing but penury, enter the match factory owners from nearby villages. They lure the credulous, illiterate villagers into sending their daughters to work at the factories from dawn to much after dusk. The initial euphoria of a steady income givesway to despair, as is clearly brought out through the story of Nallamuthu (Nasser), his wife Vadivu (Radhika) and their three children. Mariyappan (Charle) is the Match factory agent in charge of finding child labourers for the factory. While the children slog in the factories the men of the household become lazy appendages who spend their time getting drunk. Nasser, as the cynical father, who does not wish to get his daughter married because he does not want to forgo the income, has rendered a splendid performance in Karuvelam Pookal. Mention must be made of the scenes in which he cries aloud at his tragedies and when his impotent anger is turned towards the agents of the match factories. Radhika's is another sterling portrayal. In the role of a responsible mother caught between her husband's apathy and avarice and her children's untold suffering, she indeed lives the character. Sonia is the eldest daughter, Dhanalakshmi. Caught in the quagmire of drudgery and in the strangulating web of poverty, she seeks a way out, but sadly the respite is too short lived. A convincing essay by the young Actress. The visuals of the opening sequences transport you to the days of Bharatiraja's movie 16 Vayadhinilae. The beautifully captured rustic ambience is another creditable show by Thangar Bachan who has wielded the camera. The dialect, the innocent humour, the openness and the gullibility - Poomani presents them all with absolute vividness. The factories need only young girls and the boys therefore escape the hardship. After stressing on this point throughout, it is strange to see the boy accompany his sister to work, in the end. The fragrance of Karuvelam Pookkal is bound to last in the minds of the discerning audience.

Deepak lost his mother at an early age, and his father (M. S. Bhaskar) married another woman. Deepak cannot concentrate on studies because his father is making love with his wife in front of him at night. The students' only aim is having fun in class and making fun of teachers. The schoolboys spent much of their time smoking cigarettes, reading erotic novels, and chilling out eyeing for girls. The strict school headmaster A. Swaminathan (Vadivelu) has an authoritative stance. He makes their lives miserable and takes every opportunity that he has to sanction the students. One day, Bhagya attempts to commit suicide when Swaminathan humiliated her in front of the other students. Tired of Swaminathan's punishments, the students decide to get revenge on him. This led the students to take a radical decision, thus they hire the naive snake charmer Muniyandi, who looks exactly like Swaminathan, to act as the school headmaster. Thereafter, the students kidnap and sequester Swaminathan, the Tamil teacher, and Deepak's father. The uneducated Muniyandi becomes the new headmaster; therefore the students do whatever they like during the classes. One night, Suja, Payal, Bhagya, and Karishma drink a lot of alcohol. The drunk girls then join the boys and fell asleep in their beds. The next morning, they wake up with a jolt and were just wearing towels. They suspect the boys for having sex with them when they were sleeping. Deepak swears that they only changed their clothes which were full of vomit, but the girls did not believe him. In the heat of anger, Ramesh, Eashwar (Eashwar), and Pradeep (Pradeep) decide to lose their virginity, so they hire a prostitute. The prostitute confessed that she did this for paying her little brother's studies and advised the boys to focus on studying. Later, the police raided the brothel and arrested the three friends. The boys are thereupon released from jail. Deepak and his friends free Swaminathan, and they all apologize to him for being so immature. Meanwhile, Ramesh's mother Lakshmi (K. R. Savithri), who worked so hard for paying her son's studies, was so heartbroken that her son went to a brothel that she prepares a meal, which she has poisoned herself with.

His first assignment is conducting the Indian general election in Tamil Nadu and for the election, he suggests passing five laws in order to fix the electoral system. Thennavan quickly gains the support of the public. The current Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Ilanthiraiyan (Nassar), a corrupt and greedy politician who wants to win the next election, successfully convinces the Prime Minister to not pass the five laws. In the meantime, Divya (Kiran Rathod) falls in love with Thennavan and tries to convince him to marry her. To win the election, Ilanthiraiyan orders Mustafa (Thalaivasal Vijay) to plant a bomb during one of his public meetings. As he expected, the bomb kills many innocent people. Ilanthiraiyan blames his enemies to have planned it and gains sympathy from the voters. During the polls, Thennavan finds out about the sham and stops the vote counting. An angry Ilanthiraiyan takes the matter to court. In court, Thennavan provides uncontested evidence and the culprits including Ilanthiraiyan are sentenced to life imprisonment. Divya eventually marries her lover Thennavan. With Ilanthiraiyan in jail, his naive wife Pushpalatha (Urvasi) replaces him as the new chief minister and bails him out of jail. Thennavan is then arrested but Pushpalatha makes him release due to public pressure. After a small quarrel with her husband, Pushpalatha resigns from her function and her government is dismissed by the governor. With the election campaign going on full swing, Thennavan resigns from his position. He then holds a public meet: he urges the voters to boycott the election to save the country from corrupt politicians and to stop people who will try to vote. The day of the election, not a single vote has been cast and it is well received by the public. The prime minister praises Thennavan for his achievement and accepts to pass the five laws.",thennavan,thennavan vijayakanth is an honest and upright ias officer and he is handpicked by the prime minister of india to be the chief election commissioner of india his first assignment is conducting the indian general election in tamil nadu and for the election he suggests passing five laws in order to fix the electoral system thennavan quickly gains the support of the public the current chief minister of tamil nadu ilanthiraiyan nassar a corrupt and greedy politician who wants to win the next election successfully convinces the prime minister to not pass the five laws in the meantime divya kiran rathod falls in love with thennavan and tries to convince him to marry her to win the election ilanthiraiyan orders mustafa thalaivasal vijay to plant a bomb during one of his public meetings as he expected the bomb kills many innocent people ilanthiraiyan blames his enemies to have planned it and gains sympathy from the voters during the polls thennavan finds out about the sham and stops the vote counting an angry ilanthiraiyan takes the matter to court in court thennavan provides uncontested evidence and the culprits including ilanthiraiyan are sentenced to life imprisonment divya eventually marries her lover thennavan with ilanthiraiyan in jail his naive wife pushpalatha urvasi replaces him as the new chief minister and bails him out of jail thennavan is then arrested but pushpalatha makes him release due to public pressure after a small quarrel with her husband pushpalatha resigns from her function and her government is dismissed by the governor with the election campaign going on full swing thennavan resigns from his position he then holds a public meet he urges the voters to boycott the election to save the country from corrupt politicians and to stop people who will try to vote the day of the election not a single vote has been cast and it is well received by the public the prime minister praises thennavan for his achievement and accepts to pass the five laws

Amalan then warns David to not lose focus on the spiritual life and tells him to choose church over the love if he wanted to become a priest. One day, Amalan gives Nivedita a love letter. When Amalan comes to know about it, David was forced to carry a cross like Jesus did as a punishment. Later, Nivedita tells him that he did a mistake and tells him her bitter past. In the past, Nivedita was a carefree girl living with her father Muthupandi (Rajkiran) in a village. Muthupandi was a kind-hearted village chief who helped the poor and he was against the caste discrimination, thus he had a lot of enemies. Nivedita and the Brahmin boy Bharathi (C. Mukesh Kumar) were in love with each other whereas her uncle Kannan (Avinash) was deeply in love with Nivedita. Kannan then sacrificed his love for his niece and decided to secretly arrange their marriage. The day of the wedding, Muthupandi heavily wounded Kannan with his machete and threatened to kill him if they didn't stop the marriage, he then forced Kannan to marry Nivedita. After the marriage, Kannan was confined to bed, unable to walk, dependent on the help of Nivedita and felt bad for her. Kannan wanted to talk to Bharathi who was about to leave the village, Nivedita, therefore, decided to search for Bharathi. At the railway station, Nivedita saw him in a train. She then got on the moving train and she convinced Bharathi to talk with her husband. When they arrived at the home, Kannan succumbed to the injuries. The whole village started to talk ill about Nivedita and Bharathi's relationship, Muthupandi felt so embarrassed at that moment, so they have no choice but to leave the place. At the railway station, frustrated and in tears, Bharathi wanted to die but Nivedita reasoned him and got on a train leaving him alone. She travelled to Chennai in order to find a job and became a church singer. Back to the present, Nivedita goes back to the village with David. At her return, the villagers insult Nivedita for bringing shame and dishonour upon her father. Nivedita apologizes to her father Muthupandi, who is now taking care of Bharathi. When Nivetha left him, Bharathi felt sad and depressed, so he attempted to terminate his life. He jumped onto a moving train and became paralysed from the waist down.

She cannot bring herself to forget Vishwa (Mammootty), a man she has been in love with for two decades. Memories of Vishwa haunt her constantly, and upon a chance meeting with him, she discovers he too is struggling with his love for her. Both are haunted by the memory of Thulasi's cousin, a figure who is unable to control his obsession for his cousin and hide his resentment at Thulasi's feelings for Vishwa.

It is in Sundarapuri that Vishwa (Mammootty) the zamindar whom she had met 20 years ago, lives. They meet again and the feelings that had blossomed in their hearts as teenagers, are revived. Vishwa is unmarried and Thulasi has gone through an unceremonious ritual in the name of matrimony, but fear of societal stigma and innate inhibition keep them asunder.

Vignesh is the four year child of a Doctor (Rajeev). Vignesh has two elder sisters. On his Vignesh's fourth birthday the Doctor was late for the celebration; but he gives Vignesh a trumpet which he likes very much. The same night while they were celebrating, a Kabooli (Manivannan) comes with a child who was suffering from fever to the doctor. The doctor doesn't treat the child and ask him to take the child to hospital. A call comes at midnight saying that the Kabooli's son is serious. The doctor rushes to the hospital and he takes his son with him. Vignesh is very much attached to the music played by the Kabooli. Kabooli's son Madhavan dies in the hospital and he runs away from the hospital with Vignesh. After 15 years the story shifts to Chennai, where we see Kannas (Thangaraj) and Kadalas (Ilavarasu) who are street boys. They stay with Amminiamma (Sabitha Anand) and they are in love with her daughters. One of her daughters steals some valuables from the house where she does household work. In order to save them, Kannas and Kadalas go to prison. When they return, they find both are married and move out of the house with sorrow. Madhavan (Ramana) comes in search of Kannas and Kadalas because they went to prison for stealing the trumpet which was at stake. Kannas and Kadalas have buried the trumpet in the ground and now there is a circus tent around it. While trying to take it out; the trumpet is taken by Rani (Kutti Radhika) the daughter of the circus owner. Madhavan asks for the trumpet and she refuses to give it. They fight with each other and in the process Madhavan tries to prove that Rani has an illicit relation with him. Her father Meesaikarar (Anandraj) is furious and he tries to kill Madhavan.

Madhavan plays the same music which the Kabooli used to play. All in the circus tent are shocked to hear it and it is revealed that Madhavan is Meesaikarar's nephew. All in the circus tent accept him wholeheartedly. Madhavan ignores Rani and she tries to commit suicide. Madhavan confesses his love for her. While romancing he plays the same music and the doctor who was passing by hears it and he comes with his daughters and sons-in-law and they forcefully take him. Madhavan tries to leave but is given sedation. One of the sons-in-law is a police officer and the other is a doctor and they are able to arrest Meesaikarar who comes to release Madhavan. The doctor shows the photograph of dead Madhavan and the newspaper articles reporting the kidnap of Vignesh to the people in the circus tent. Meesaikarar is released under the condition that they would leave the city within 48 hours. Meesaikarar is also furious and says that he will marry off his daughter within 48 hours and his son would curse him for being his father. Kannas and Kadalas come to Madhavan's house and she stops them. She requests Kannas and Kadalas not to take her son back to the streets. Kannas and Kadalas reveal the love between Madhavan and Rani and also tell her that Madhavan would be happy only with Rani. The doctor also decides to leave the city the next morning.

He falls in love with a college girl named Uma (Sridevi Vijaykumar). Gradually, Uma also reciprocates Babu's feelings and things go smoothly for a while. Uma's parents find her a wealthy groom who is well educated. Uma is in a dilemma on whom to choose as her life partner. She thinks of her future if she chooses the impoverished Babu where she visualizes herself giving birth to a child in a government hospital, her husband unable to raise required money for her medical expenses and overall a very difficult life; in contrast to a life where she is pampered by everyone, her every need taken care of almost instantly if she chooses to marry the groom selected by her parents. While Babu is on a religious trip to Sabarimala, the girl decides to marry the groom Bala (Kunal) so that she can continue to lead a comfortable life. Babu is devastated when he learns of this and heartbroken when Uma goes to the extent of slapping him when he accuses her parents of changing her mind. In a unique way, Babu files a case against Uma for not holding the promise made to him of sharing a life together for a good 50 years. The case soon gathers momentum and has the public discussing it everywhere. As the case progresses, several sacrifices made by Babu for the sake of Uma come into light through revelations made by people known to him and by his close friends. Uma has a change of heart and on the final day of the hearing, decides to re-unite with Babu.

As he sees his life pass him by, stuck in a rut in his hometown, he decides that he will try his fortunes elsewhere. Chennai beckons him and off goes Shakti, to join his uncle Kirikalam (Vadivelu), who has a stall of magic tricks at an exhibition. No, Kirikalam is not really a magician, but is posing as one and his amateurish tricks don't exactly bring in big crowds. Next door to Shakti and Kirikalam's stall though, is one ever-populated with visitors. The reason: it's an all-girls stand, with mermaid costumes as the theme.

This misunderstanding is seen at different occasions where Velli and Madhavan just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - be it when Shakti gets off the bus from his village, asks for directions and is told to follow Velli, walking in the distance (Velli thinks he's a womaniser) or when Shakti finally catches up with a miscreant who had picked his pocket and demands his money backâ€""only Velli walks into the scene only at the demanding part.

Kokila (Sneha) works in the school where she had also studied. The school was constructed by Kokila's grandfather years ago and dispute arises between her family members, where her uncle wanted to demolish the school and sell the land as the school is in a very bad state. The school teachers come up with a plan of organising an alumni get together, so that the school can be saved. Kumarasamy aka Kumar (Thagar Bachan) is a poor man who lives in the same village and is the classmate of Kokila. He is sent to Kanchipuram to meet the district collector Vetrivel (Naren) who also happens to be the alumni of the same school. Vetri and Kumar were close friends during childhood and both feel happy meeting after years. Meanwhile, the two also get to meet Muthu (Seeman) who is a film director now and is also their close friend. All the three friends get united after many years. A flashback is shown where Vetri, Kumar and Muthu were close friends during schooldays. All three belong to poor families and Vetri falls in love with his classmate Kokila, who is a rich girl. Jhansi (Shriya) is a nurse who visits the village for conducting a medical camp. All three boys get closer to Jhansi as she is kind and she looks after them very well. Jhansi takes care of Muthu's education after his father's sudden death. Meanwhile, Vetri and Kokila's love affair is known to her family members and they accuse that Jhansi helped the love and insults her in front of the villagers. Jhansi gets hurt and leaves the village. Muthu also leaves the village along with Jhansi . Vetri goes out of village for undergraduation. Vetri clears civil services and comes back to village with plans of marrying Kokila in a registrar office. But Kokila refuses getting married without her family's consent and requests Vetri to meet her parents once with the hope that they would agree as he is well educated now. But, Kokila's father beat Vetri and his father and in the fight, Vetri's father dies. Kokila's family members lock her in a room. Vetri gets furious that Kokila didn't turn up at the time of his visit and also worries due to his father's death. Vetri decides to leave the village with no plans of returning again. Coming back to present, all three friends meet and share their old good memories. Muthu is married and he takes care of Jhansi still. Also Kumar is married.

Kumar and Muthu convince Vetri to come to village. Kokila still loves Vetri but Kumar lies to Kokila that Vetri is married which makes Kokila angry. Kokila feels that Vetri has ditched her and started a new life while she still loves him. An event has been organized to celebrate the 75th year of the school by inviting all the alumni. Vetri and Muthu are invited as special guests as that would make the event more popular. Vetri and Muthu arrive at the village and visit their school. Vetri and Kokila donot talk to each other.

When Ramakrishnan questions the leader Sivarasan (Mansoor Ali Khan), he remains silent. Another LTTE member (Rajesh) who was not caught phones Subha Sundaram to release his fellows. Ramakrishnan releases them and they proceed to Sri Lanka. Divya parks her car in a no parking area and refuses to move the car. When asked by a traffic constable, she shows Ramakrishnan's visiting car. Arun orders to seize the car and also tears up the visiting card when Divya shows it. Divya complains to Ramakrishnan and asks him to get the car and an apology from Arun. Ramakrishnan convinces Arun to give her car back. Then Ramakrishnan and Divya get married. One day in a meeting, the DGP (M. N. Nambiar) informs that the state govt may be dismissed, so they have to tighten security in Chennai since ruling party supporters may indulge in violence. Sivarasan, Dhanu and group of 12 people arrive in a boat from Jaffna to Point Calimere, they are received by the smuggler Shanmugam, who accommodates them. Sivarasan exchanges suitcase of gold biscuits for money. Sivarasan then goes to Subha Sundaram's house to find the photographer. Then Subha introduces Hari babu to Sivarasan. Sivarasan insists Haribabu to take photos of all political party leaders homes, offices etc. and when the latter ask for a reason, Sivarasan says it is for a book to be published worldwide. The DGP informs that Rajiv Gandhi (Anupam Kher) will arrive in Sriperumbudur for an election rally and they must guard him since he is under threat of terrorists. Sivarasan and other LTTE members assemble and plan to kill Rajiv Gandhi during the election rally. They then conduct a mock drill of the assassination and prepare a belt bomb. Rajiv Gandhi arrives and gives his answers on Ramjanmabhoomi and the Sri Lankan issue to reporters at a press meet. He then garlands Indira Gandhi's statue and arrives at the venue. Dhanu sneaks in as a person to garland Rajiv Gandhi. Arun doesn't allow her since she is not on the list. When Rajiv Gandhi arrives, he lets Dhanu garland him when a female constable stops her and she activates the bomb. Confusion follows after the blast and wires short-circuit due to the impact. A colleague of Haribabu phones Subha Sundaram that Hari is dead due to the blast. Subha asks him to get Hari's camera saying it is very important. The riots break out in Chennai city due to Rajiv Gandhi's death and a small hotel owner asks Sivarasan and others to leave due to the tension. They all leave in a Maruthi van. The rioters plan to cut up a DMK flag. But a DMK worker (Chandrasekhar) fights them. Ramakrishnan intervenes and the worker recites poetry saying that they are not weak but they follow their party orders since they believe their party as a family. A voiceover of Muthuvel Karunanidhi is heard saying that at this unfortunate time, people may provoke and try to demoralise the party but they must not lose their hope. Arun tries to talk with DGP regarding suspension of officers. A Congress leader asks the DGP to release his party men. The DGP says rowdies and goondas are using this situation so they cannot differentiate between rowdy and party members. Arun asks why they have been suspended the Congress leader says they should be dismissed. Arun loses his cool when the Congress leader says police have chickened out and run, Arun says that since there where no party people and only police, common people died. Arun asks whether they knew of the blast before, he storms out and Ramakrishnan follows him. The DGP asks the leader to go away since politicians and police still have respect. Karthickeyan (Vijayakumar) from (New Delhi) arrives to investigate the case. Sivarasan says they are at a critical stage of their mission and says that the Tamil Nadu coast has come into control of the Indian Navy so they cannot escape via sea. Another LTTE commander (Rajesh) says that Karthickeyan is a competent officer and says that they must not use old contacts and must remain underground till further instructions. Karthickeyan arrives in Chennai. He tells the officials that they must not believe in a single path to cracking the case. He also says that the Press can divert them by posting rumours. He visits the assassination site and then later in headquarters and asks Ramakrishnan to develop the film from Haribabu's camera. In Thiruthuraipoondi, Shankar gets caught and based on his diary, the officers arrest Nalini's mother, brother and finally Nalini and Murugan. Based on their confessions, they arrest Subha Sundaram and Shanmugham and also find a large cache of weapons in the safe house and beaches. Meanwhile the hit squad moves to Mysore and lies low as per instructions. Sivarasan says that only one mission is completed. The investigating team gets information of Sivarasan and others hiding in Konakunte near Mysore. They proceed and after a standoff, Sivarasan and Subha commit suicide and also destroy all evidence. In an ADMK victory celebration of Jayalalithaa, the tigers plan to kill her, but Ramakrishnan recognizes and shoots him. While trying to find out about others, a militant who was disguised as officer kills the militant. Then Ramakrishnan chases him and kills him. The militants then threaten Ramakrishnan that they will kill his wife. Arun goes to Ramakrishnan's home and manages to kill the militant even though he is heavily injured.

Matters become colourful when a demure young daughter, Madumitha (Poorna) of a local bigwig, Ramaiyya gives first preference to the members of his caste. Madumitha makes a coquettish play for all of Muniyandi's friends, but hits it off with him first. Following a heated skirmish in the caste-dominated college elections, the two fall in love. Or so you think. Also part of the mix is Sorimuthu Ayyanar (Vadivelu), who raises some laughs as the local witch-doctor, complete with bells and saffron cloth regalia. But everything goes topsy-turvy when, once Madumitha's marriage is arranged, she turns around and says that she was never in love with Muniyandi in the first place. Furious, the guy thrashes her with his slippers and sets fire to her father's coconut grove. It is little things like these that set this movie slightly apart from others in the same genre; the hero and heroines come across as genuine characters, angry, sad and sorrowful. Madumitha is no slinking pathetic thing either; she gives back as good as she gets.

 (42)","Pandi (Raghava Lawrence) does menial jobs in Dubai and saves every penny he earns and sends it to his family in Usilampatti. A flashback reveals that he was a carefree youth who was often chided by his father Sundarapandi (Nassar). His elder brother Rajapandi (Sriman) is the blue-eyed boy of his father. However, Pandi's mother Sivagami (Saranya Ponvannan) showers all her love and affection on him. His mother has a dream of building her own house in her land. Rajapandi asks Pandi to go to a marriage ceremony. While on the train, he met Bhuvana (Sneha), a cop's daughter in the other village, and after a sequence of events, romance blossoms between them. One afternoon, Bhuvana gives all the money she has on her person to Pandi and convinces him to take her out to lunch at a restaurant. After eating his lunch, he went outside to wash his hands and saw his sister and her boyfriend having a conversation. Pandi chases the motorbike on an auto, leaving Bhuvana stuck with the bill and no money, having given it all to Pandi. When Pandi eventually catches up with the boyfriend, the boyfriend tells him that they are seriously in love, and he is going to be coming over to their place with his parents to ask for her hand in marriage. Everything was going well until a couple days later, Sundarapandi wanted the money to buy the jewelry. Pandi's family receives a shock as Sivagami cannot find the money that they have saved up to pay for the wedding. Since Pandi is already a known troublemaker and has been to jail already, Sundarapandi blames Pandi and kicks him out of the house. This happens in front of Bhuvana, who has come to see where he has been the last few days and why he ran away at the restaurant. This incident with Sundarapandi accusing Pandi of taking the money has convinced her that he took her money the other day and ran and also just using her. In the end, it turns out that Rajapandi has run away from the house with his lover and with the money. Sundarapandi is consoled by Pandi, who borrows money from a private money lender and completes the wedding. Meanwhile, Pandi tries to make amends with Bhuvana, but she will not hear any of it. Sundarapandi, seeing the argument, went over and told Bhuvana the truth and how he misjudged his son and that is was not him that took the money. The following day, Sundarapandi went to Bhuvana's house to ask her father Periyamaayan (Ilavarasu) to fix a marriage between Pandi and Bhuvana. Periyamaayan, upon hearing this, gets furious. He is the local police inspector and knows all about Pandi's past. He refuses to marry his daughter to a criminal. Periyamaayan arranges a marriage for Bhuvana, but she went to Sundarapandi to say that she will die before marrying another person than Pandi. Pandi snatched Bhuvana from her house, takes her to the police station, and asks her father to approve of their marriage. Periyamaayan gets angry and says that Bhuvana is not his daughter anymore and that he will think his daughter eloped and lost. Pandi marries Bhuvana and as police protection, Periyamaayan watches her getting married. Determined to pay back the loan and help his family overcome their financial constraint, Pandi decides to go abroad and work as a conservancy staff. He manages to stabilize his family with his earnings. However, on his return, he is shocked to find his mother dead. Coming to know that it was no natural death, he decides to avenge the killers.

A traffic policeman, Kandasamy (Vivek), ignores that violation because he is a close friend of Sathya. A social activist and lawyer, Udhayamoorthy (Vijayakumar), drags both of them to court for obstructing traffic and causing a nuisance. Instead of sentencing them, the court sends them to the Madurai Gandhi Museum for help, where they meet a college student named Meenakshi (Anjali). After he is discharged, Sathya starts a job as a henchman. VBR (Manivannan), a villainous former minister, sends him to steal a confidential file containing vital evidence on the death of the collector Leelavathi (Sukanya) at Udhayamoorthy's place. While he is stealing the file, Udhayamoorthy is killed by Sathya. While dying, Udhayamoorthy blesses Sathya by saying ""Vazhga Valamudan"" (Long Live). These last words haunt Sathya, and, filled with remorse, he vows to carry on Udhayamoorthy's good work. He gathers evidence to discover the murderer of Leelavathi, even as VBR burns the documents to destroy the evidence. Sathya continues with his task of exposing VBR, and adopts Gandhian principles of non-violence and peaceful Satyagraha. Ezhumalai (Napolean) is a police inspector who vows to avenge the death of his brother, Udhayamoorthy. He thinks that Sathya had killed him, although he later finds out that he didn't. Sathya sits near the Gandhi statue and follows his examples of non-violence, confident that VBR will be arrested. VBR surrenders himself to police and is arrested.

 (32)","Raja (Raghava Lawrence) is a native of Coutrallam. Tragedy strikes his adolescent life when his father loses his hand when a doctor in an inebriated condition operates on him. The doctor fearing legal consequences bribes the local police to take care of the issue. Young Raja witnesses police brutality on his father causing his father's health to deteriorate. On his deathbed, his father gets a promise from Raja that he would make his three brothers into a cop, lawyer, and doctor. Raja realises his mission, and stops his studies to earn money to make his brothers into what he promised. The brothers are provided shelter and food by a local elderly woman (Paravai Muniyamma) whom Raja affectionately calls as paati. She has a granddaughter Lakshmi (Neelima Rani), whom Raja considers as his own sister. Now Raja in his adulthood makes ends meet as a bus driver, while his three brothers become doctor, policeman and lawyer as per his father's wish. One day, his sister shows disinterest in going to college and complains about eve-teasing. Raja dismisses the claim and asks her to attend. She convinces him to come with her. On seeing her a group of college men start ogling her. Raja walks up to them, and suggests them toogle at voluptuous women like Nayanthara and leave not so good looking girls like his sister alone. The youths ignoring his words, remarks that Raja's sister indeed has a curvy Hourglass figure and proceeds to molest her. Enraged by this Raja fights and chases them away warning others to stay away from his sister. Raja is then kidnapped by Thangapazham (Meenakshi) while he is asleep by a group of woman she controls. She expresses her lust over Raja and pronounces that she will get him to do what she says. Raja escapes from her while she's distracted. Thangapazham is then kidnapped by Krishnamoorthy (Karunas) who inturn expresses his lust over thangapazham which she blatantly ignores. Meanwhile Shailja (Mumtaj), a woman gangster turned politician who openly admits to having slept her way to become a minister, is seen beating up a cop for not falling on her feet. Eventually she murders him and mocks at his dead body for falling on her feet after death. Thangapazham again woos Raja this time asking him to massage her. Raja reluctantly agrees and takes her to a secluded place where he oil massages the half naked woman. On seeing his woman of interest with another man, Krishnamurthy gets aroused and jealous at the same time. During a college function Lakshmi and Shailaja get into an altercation. Shailaja takes Lakshmi and beats her. Raja comes to his sister's rescue beating up goons. He then proceeds to remove Shailaja's sari to humiliate her and forces her followers to sexually assault her. When a follower remarks she's like a sister, Raja mentions that after ogling Shailaja's body from top to bottom for so long, it was time they cut their dirty imaginations and proceed to perform real actions. He pushes some of them towards her and takes few pictures while they fall on her. Later, Raja is once again kidnapped by Thangapazham, this time wearing slinky clothes to arouse Raja. She proceeds to threaten Raja and forces him to measure her body with a tape. He reluctantly measure her waist and hips. When measuring her bust while Raja initially tries to look away, Thangapazham forces him to see her while doing so to arouse him. He measures and is shocked at the size. Thangapazham remarks that two inches have increased and that it's fine. Raja then gets into a local Jallikattu competition which he eventually wins. The organizer, a local village chief announces that Raja will wed his daughter. He pulls his friend Krishna Murthy along in this mess. At the wedding Raja is desperate to escape but unable to do so. Thangapazham enters and stops the wedding by throwing a hand grenade in the crowd causing people to run. After this, Lakshmi gets sick and is admitted into one of the hospitals run by Raja's brother. However turning greedy he demands money and gets into a fight with Paati. He then brutally murders the sister out of rage and the old woman to eliminate a possible eyewitness. It is revealed that all three brothers are corrupt and accomplices of Shailaja. After learning this, Raja swears an oath to eliminate the three brothers by betraying them while acting to be on their side. When spying on his brothers he meets with Nikhita (Snigdha Akolkar), a girl who admires Raja for his character. It is revealed that she is the sister of the dreaded Shailaja. The lawyer brother, during his visit to a local school, wishes to sexually abuse a girl. He then eventually sedates and proceeds to abuse her. Raja wearing a helmet enters and beats the brother vigorously, saving the girl. His brother can't see the face of the assaulter. Enters Nurse Namitha (Kamna Jethmalani),a buxom woman ogled by many men in the hospital. Raja eventually ends up befriending her, when he tries to perform a stint against his brother to collect evidences. Raja then witnesses his police brother brutally stir up a riot and intentionally kill an innocent civilian using a sledgehammer brutally smashing the skull. At night, when the police officer pairs up with a high-class prostitute Babilona for sex in his police vehicle, Raja ties the vehicle and traps them inside using a crane. He gets caught red-handed the next morning and is suspended from office. The three brothers initially suspect Raja, but he manipulates them into believing that he's innocent. The doctor brother is a pervert who keeps camera inside the nurses' dressing room and watches while they change dress. Watching one such nurse remove her dress, he's called for work. Using this opportunity Raja enters and breaks the camera, stealing the doctor's laptop for evidence. He beats the doctor viciously. Later knowing about her sister and his friendship, Shailaja orders her goons to beat up Raja. He beats them and shows that he is unbeatable. He then proceeds to slap Shailaja in her butt, mocking her in the process. He then asks Nikita to slap her sister Shailaja using her footwear, in order for him to love her, which she happily does. During an award ceremony for his doctor brother, Raja blackmails using the previous evidences he gathered, forcing him to agree and announce infront of the crowd that he will perform 100 heart surgeries for free. Shailaja later enters the brothers home for a meet. Fearing recognition Raja masks his face with cream and mimicks a feminine voice. Failing to recognise him, she has a quick convo with Raja. Raja then asks Shailaja to adjust her sari, mocking that she is exposing her assets. During a visit to a temple, Shailaja is in her caravan travelling. The caravan is abducted and taken control by Raja and Krishna Murthy. He then remarks that his lover, Shailaja's sister is a little thin while Shailaja on the other hand is a buxom woman, who is naturally arousing to men. He then forces Shailaja to wear slinky clothes using an evidence of her murdering a temple official. She agrees out of fear, now all of her thighs exposed, a shy Shailaja reluctantly gets down.

However, Jothi did not want to marry Surya: she found him not-good-looking and not educated enough; above all else, she was afraid of him. Surya then tried to change his looks and behavior.

Surya even suspected her uncle (Kovai Madhan) from Dubai of wooing Jothi. In the meantime, Jothi started to like Surya for being caring and protective.

Her words shook him so much, that Ganesan all of a sudden has an epileptic seizure in front of her and no one came to help him. Ganesan then decides to earn an honest living but Thiruvaachi who has a grudge against Ganesan tries to stop him. Meanwhile, Thiruvaachi wants to marry his cousin Raji and confronts Ganesan. In the past, Thiruvaachi was the son of the wealthy man Azhagar (L. Raja) while Ganesan was the son of their servant Manikkam (V. Venkatesh). Being constantly and unfavourably compared with Ganesan who was academically-inclined, Thiruvachi had developed a hatred for Ganesan and he had slowly become a wastrel. One day, Thiruvaachi stabbed to death his own father Azhagar in front of Ganesan and a shocked Ganesan had his first epileptic seizure but before dying, Azhagar requested Ganesan to endure Thiruvachi's evil deeds for the good of Kottaiyan. Thiruvaachi left the place and blamed Ganesan for killing his father. The innocent Ganesan spent time in jail and he then became Thiruvaachi's henchman. Back to the present, Ganesan fights back and defeats Thiruvaachi. Raji eventually accepts to marry a reformed Ganesan and they get engaged with the blessings of Raji's mother, Gilaki, Gilaki's newly married wife Annakili (Janaki) and the villagers. Thiruvaachi then abducts Annakili and he threatens to rape her unless Gilaki gives Kottaiyan up. Gilaki surprisingly makes the exchange and he then feels guilty of betraying his best friend. The next day, Gilaki is found hanging from a tree and Annakili reveals everything to Ganesan. Ganesan sets out to find his brother but Thiruvaachi mercilessly kills Kottaiyan. Ganesan and Raji track Thiruvaachi down and they find the dead body of Kottaiyan. Ganesan begins to have an epileptic seizure but he manages to control it and Thiruvaachi attacks the couple.

 (10)","Gautham Francis (Prathaap Ravichandran) is a man who suffers from paranoia. In spite of his health condition, he is an intellectually gifted human being, believing in much more significant values than the common citizen of modern society. In order to create his own fortune, Gautham is in search of a job, however, this is an impossible task, since his medical report states that he is a paranoid patient. 

On the verge of being completely rejected by society, Gautham accidently meets Avinash Kumaran (Diluckshan Jeyaratnam), a psychology graduate student. Avinash realises the fact that Gautham is mentally ill, which gives him the idea of writing his masters thesis based on Gautham and his disease. In order to shadow Gautham thoroughly, Avinash turns to his friend Venkatesh Sivakumar aka. Venkat (Geethendra Sugendra), the CEO of the newly founded company InnoTech. Together, they both offer Gautham a job at InnoTech for a trial period of one month, in which Avinash is to thoroughly note Gauthams behavior and reactions in certain conditions.

In spite of finally getting a job, Gautham has not fulfilled his purpose yet. He is still searching for the significant values in life. His greatest wish is to obtain a caring relationship, which he never had, with his sister, Soumya (Stefeja Vasantharasan). Whether he gets to live life, as he wishes it, and thereby fulfills his purpose forms the crux of the story.

Paranoid Patient is a film, which deals with a man who is in search of compassion, friendship and love. However, he is placed in a society filled with selfishness, greed, and ignorance of these significant values. The film does not illustrate how modern society is, on the contrary, it demonstrates how modern society should not be.",paranoid patient,gautham francis prathaap ravichandran is a man who suffers from paranoia in spite of his health condition he is an intellectually gifted human being believing in much more significant values than the common citizen of modern society in order to create his own fortune gautham is in search of a job however this is an impossible task since his medical report states that he is a paranoid patient on the verge of being completely rejected by society gautham accidently meets avinash kumaran diluckshan jeyaratnam a psychology graduate student avinash realises the fact that gautham is mentally ill which gives him the idea of writing his masters thesis based on gautham and his disease in order to shadow gautham thoroughly avinash turns to his friend venkatesh sivakumar aka venkat geethendra sugendra the ceo of the newly founded company innotech together they both offer gautham a job at innotech for a trial period of one month in which avinash is to thoroughly note gauthams behavior and reactions in certain conditions in spite of finally getting a job gautham has not fulfilled his purpose yet he is still searching for the significant values in life his greatest wish is to obtain a caring relationship which he never had with his sister soumya stefeja vasantharasan whether he gets to live life as he wishes it and thereby fulfills his purpose forms the crux of the story paranoid patient is a film which deals with a man who is in search of compassion friendship and love however he is placed in a society filled with selfishness greed and ignorance of these significant values the film does not illustrate how modern society is on the contrary it demonstrates how modern society should not be

 (176)","Marwan, an attractive young immigrant from Sri Lanka, has been working as a kitchen assistant in a star restaurant in Zurich since the death of his parents in the Sri Lankan civil war, but dreams of having his own restaurant. He wants to combine traditional Indian cuisine, as his great aunt taught him, with avant-garde molecular cuisine. Their motto is ""Cooking is transforming"": cold to hot, hard to soft, sour to sweet. It turns out that his creations have a strong aphrodisiac effect: when he invites his co-worker Andrea to dinner, she seduces him after eating, even though she is a lesbian and even though she is very conservative. And thinks arranged marriages are right. The two of them founded a joint catering service called Love Food, which they use to bring new life into the love lives of married couples who have undergone sex therapy.

Since Marwan needs money for his terminally ill great aunt, the catering company turns into an environment of commercial sex. Andrea's partner Makeda, who works for an escort service, makes contact. Business is booming and money is flowing liberally into Marwan's pockets. Meanwhile, Marvan's nephew Ulagu returns to his homeland and is recruited by the Tamil guerrilla fighters the Tamil Tigers. Marwan fails to save him; Ulagu died from a weapon that suspected businessman Dalman - a client of the catering service - could have delivered to the crisis zone.

When Marwan's aunt also dies, Marwan decides to stop cooking for Love Food. During the last meal that he prepares for Dalman and Andrea's girlfriend, he ensures that Dalman, who has a heart condition, dies due to the drug mixed in his drink. Andrea and Makeda come together and Marwan can turn to the delicate Sandana, with whom a marriage was arranged for him, but who initially rejected him.",der koch,marwan an attractive young immigrant from sri lanka has been working as a kitchen assistant in a star restaurant in zurich since the death of his parents in the sri lankan civil war but dreams of having his own restaurant he wants to combine traditional indian cuisine as his great aunt taught him with avant garde molecular cuisine their motto is cooking is transforming cold to hot hard to soft sour to sweet it turns out that his creations have a strong aphrodisiac effect when he invites his co worker andrea to dinner she seduces him after eating even though she is a lesbian and even though she is very conservative and thinks arranged marriages are right the two of them founded a joint catering service called love food which they use to bring new life into the love lives of married couples who have undergone sex therapy since marwan needs money for his terminally ill great aunt the catering company turns into an environment of commercial sex andrea s partner makeda who works for an escort service makes contact business is booming and money is flowing liberally into marwan s pockets meanwhile marvan s nephew ulagu returns to his homeland and is recruited by the tamil guerrilla fighters the tamil tigers marwan fails to save him ulagu died from a weapon that suspected businessman dalman a client of the catering service could have delivered to the crisis zone when marwan s aunt also dies marwan decides to stop cooking for love food during the last meal that he prepares for dalman and andrea s girlfriend he ensures that dalman who has a heart condition dies due to the drug mixed in his drink andrea and makeda come together and marwan can turn to the delicate sandana with whom a marriage was arranged for him but who initially rejected him

Kathir uses this opportunity to take revenge against the violent bar owner who humiliated him in front of his friends, despite Prabhakar's advice.

 (6.9K)","""Aloko Udapadi"" (""Light Arose"") is an Epic Film of the unswerving human effort to record for all time, a unique spiritual heritage. In 89 BC, King Walagamba of Sinhala kingdom (present day Sri Lanka), was troubled by power-hungry forces from within and from outside, which compelled him to abandon throne and flee with a hope of returning back to power. A severe drought and a subsequent famine assailed the land for 12 unbroken years. Buddhist Monks who perpetuated Lord Buddha's word by oral tradition, could not survive the harsh conditions. The monks were troubled both by the enemy and the famine. In these dark days, the loyal subjects protected their King. Enemy leaders killed each other for power and wealth. Well armed, the King dealt a deadly blow and regained the rule and brought back the freedom the natives lost. In peace and prosperity, the monks facing the challenge wrote down the oral tradition. The Buddha's compassionate teaching became an irreducible component of the whole of human culture. It is a story of how a smaller nation arose together to face off the darkest days of the history of the land.",aloko udapadi,aloko udapadi light arose is an epic film of the unswerving human effort to record for all time a unique spiritual heritage in 89 bc king walagamba of sinhala kingdom present day sri lanka was troubled by power hungry forces from within and from outside which compelled him to abandon throne and flee with a hope of returning back to power a severe drought and a subsequent famine assailed the land for 12 unbroken years buddhist monks who perpetuated lord buddha s word by oral tradition could not survive the harsh conditions the monks were troubled both by the enemy and the famine in these dark days the loyal subjects protected their king enemy leaders killed each other for power and wealth well armed the king dealt a deadly blow and regained the rule and brought back the freedom the natives lost in peace and prosperity the monks facing the challenge wrote down the oral tradition the buddha s compassionate teaching became an irreducible component of the whole of human culture it is a story of how a smaller nation arose together to face off the darkest days of the history of the land

 (5)","Ravi, a cashier in a well known bakery group in Chennai, faces heartbreak as his nearly fixed wedding breaks due to his night blindness caused by his congenital impairment. Realizing his impairment is the reason he is not getting anywhere in his life, Ravi plans to start his own business and overcome it. He seeks his parents' financial aid for the same, but his hope gets dashed once again as the conversation ends in another fight between his parents. That's when Parvatham approaches him again for the idol, offering him a tidy sum in return. She also tempts him, saying that he could travel abroad with the money she gives him and treat his night blindness effectively. Naturally, this entices Ravi, and some plans start emerging in his mind.

In the meantime, due to many inauspicious incidents and endless obstacles hitting the family's peaceful life, Gomathi's family conducts a Kavidi prashnam under the supervision of their family astrologer. In the Kavidi prashnam, it is suggested that the only way to end their bad luck is to move the Ganesha idol back to the family temple. Gomathi, who has a blind belief in such matters, agrees to do it in no time. When Gomathi informs Ravi about these new turns of events, Ravi's dreams surrounding the idol get shattered. Ravi steals the Ganesha idol from his mother's bedroom on that rainy night. He hides it in his cousin's old car lying unwanted outside their house for ages.

Ravi tries to contact Parvatham to sell the stolen idol, but he can't reach her. Since he has no information about her whereabouts, Ravi falls into total crisis. In that desperation, Ravi contacts Charles, a pickpocket from the Vaathuruthi colony, whom he met at the police station a few days ago. After listening to Ravi's problems, Charles unconditionally agrees to help him out. So Ravi and Charles venture out to find an appropriate place to sell the idol. They go to many shops and centres of Kochi where such fraudulent activities take place. This journey develops a deep friendship between them.

Charles' company reinstates Ravi's lost confidence and positivity. After passing through many struggles and days of tense moments, Charles and Ravi finally sell the idol, which also brings Gomathi's ideas about God to new heights. With the money he earns from the Ganesha idol, Ravi starts a shop selling idols.

At this time, some of the villagers who have vowed pilgrimage to Lord Ayyappan await to begin their journey to the temple. However, the forest officers forbid them from getting out of the village until the tiger is caught. People who have completed 48 days of fasting decide to go to the temple without the knowledge of the forest officials and tie Irumudi and come down from the hill overnight.
